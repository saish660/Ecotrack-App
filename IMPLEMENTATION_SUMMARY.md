# EcoTrack OneSignal Integration - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

- ‚úÖ Added `onesignal_player_id` field to `PushSubscription` model
- ‚úÖ Added `provider` field to track notification service ('fcm', 'onesignal', 'web_push')
- ‚úÖ Updated model methods to handle both FCM and OneSignal credentials
- ‚úÖ Database migrations created and ready to apply

### 2. Backend Integration

- ‚úÖ Updated `OneSignalService` class for sending notifications
- ‚úÖ Modified subscription views to handle OneSignal player IDs
- ‚úÖ Updated test notification endpoint to support both FCM and OneSignal
- ‚úÖ Enhanced notification settings API to return provider information

### 3. Notification Scheduling

- ‚úÖ Created `send_onesignal_notifications.py` management command
- ‚úÖ Updated main notification scheduler to handle both systems
- ‚úÖ Modified FCM notifications to only target FCM subscribers

### 4. Frontend Integration

- ‚úÖ Created `notifications_median.js` for Median app integration
- ‚úÖ Built smart platform detection with `notifications_loader.js`
- ‚úÖ Updated templates to use intelligent notification system
- ‚úÖ Implemented OneSignal JavaScript Bridge integration

### 5. Configuration & Settings

- ‚úÖ Added OneSignal settings to Django configuration
- ‚úÖ Created environment variable template (`.env.template`)
- ‚úÖ Updated Django settings to include OneSignal credentials

### 6. Documentation

- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive setup guide (`ONESIGNAL_SETUP.md`)
- ‚úÖ Added environment configuration examples
- ‚úÖ Created integration test script

## üîß Configuration Required

### Environment Variables Needed:

```bash
ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=your_onesignal_app_id
ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY=your_onesignal_rest_api_key
```

### Steps to Complete Setup:

1. **OneSignal Account Setup**

   - Create OneSignal account
   - Create new app
   - Get App ID and REST API Key

2. **Median App Configuration**

   - Enable OneSignal plugin in Median
   - Add your OneSignal App ID

3. **Environment Setup**

   - Add OneSignal credentials to `.env` file
   - Run database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`

4. **Firebase Integration**
   - Upload your Firebase `google-services.json` to OneSignal
   - OneSignal will handle FCM integration automatically

## üöÄ How It Works

### Platform Detection

- **Web browsers**: Automatically uses Firebase FCM
- **Median apps**: Automatically uses OneSignal
- Detection happens via JavaScript in `notifications_loader.js`

### User Registration Flow

1. User enables notifications in the app
2. System detects platform (web/Median)
3. For Median: Gets OneSignal player ID via JavaScript Bridge
4. For Web: Gets FCM token via Firebase SDK
5. Stores appropriate credentials in database with provider info

### Notification Sending

1. Notification scheduler runs every minute
2. Sends FCM notifications to `provider='fcm'` subscribers
3. Sends OneSignal notifications to `provider='onesignal'` subscribers
4. Uses personalized AI-generated messages via Gemini

## üì± Median JavaScript Bridge Integration

The system uses Median's JavaScript Bridge to:

- Detect when app is running in Median wrapper
- Get OneSignal player ID automatically
- Handle notification permissions
- Set external user IDs for targeting

Key functions implemented:

- `median_onesignal_info()` - Callback for OneSignal data
- `median_library_ready()` - Called when bridge is available
- Platform detection via `navigator.userAgent` and `window.median`

## üß™ Testing

### What's Working:

- ‚úÖ Database schema is correctly updated
- ‚úÖ OneSignal service integration is ready
- ‚úÖ Management commands are available
- ‚úÖ Platform detection is implemented
- ‚úÖ API endpoints support both systems

### To Test:

1. Set OneSignal credentials in `.env`
2. Build Median app with OneSignal enabled
3. Test notification subscription in app
4. Verify notifications are received
5. Test web version still works with FCM

## üìã Files Modified/Created

### New Files:

- `ecotrack/static/notifications_median.js` - Median OneSignal integration
- `ecotrack/static/notifications_loader.js` - Smart platform detection
- `ecotrack/management/commands/send_onesignal_notifications.py` - OneSignal notifications
- `.env.template` - Environment variables template
- `ONESIGNAL_SETUP.md` - Complete setup documentation
- `test_onesignal_integration.py` - Integration test script

### Modified Files:

- `ecotrack/models.py` - Added OneSignal fields and methods
- `ecotrack/views.py` - Updated for dual notification support
- `ecotrack/onesignal_service.py` - Enhanced OneSignal integration
- `DjangoProject/settings.py` - Added OneSignal configuration
- `notification_scheduler.py` - Dual notification system
- `ecotrack/templates/index.html` - Smart notification loader
- Database migrations - New OneSignal fields

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Set OneSignal Credentials**

   ```bash
   # Add to .env file
   ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
   ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Configure Median App**

   - Enable OneSignal plugin
   - Add your App ID
   - Build and test

3. **Test Integration**

   - Test notifications in Median app
   - Verify web notifications still work
   - Check notification delivery in OneSignal dashboard

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Set up proper environment variables
   - Configure notification scheduler as cron job
   - Monitor notification delivery rates

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

- **No OneSignal Player ID**: Check Median app OneSignal configuration
- **Notifications not sending**: Verify API credentials and app permissions
- **Platform not detected**: Check JavaScript console for bridge errors

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Test OneSignal notifications
python manage.py send_onesignal_notifications --dry-run

# Test FCM notifications
python manage.py send_daily_notifications --dry-run

# Check database schema
python manage.py dbshell
```

The integration is now complete and ready for testing with your OneSignal credentials!
